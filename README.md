### Overview:

As touted by the website below, this was a study on Belly Button Biodiversity where they claim "The coolest study of biodiversity on the human body on the planet!" and then discuss the belly button as a *habitat*.

If you are so intrigued, there is an attached website <a href="http://robdunnlab.com/science-portfolio/bellybutton-portrait-series/?portfolioCats=38">Bellybutton Portrait Series </a>
<p><em>The Bellybutton Portrait Series is a set of photographs of microbial cultures of individuals that double as portraits of the subjectâ€™s microbial selves.</em></p>
