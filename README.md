## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
### Overview:

As touted by the website below, this was a study on Belly Button Biodiversity where they claim "The coolest study of biodiversity on the human body on the planet!" and then discuss the belly button as a *habitat*.

If you are so intrigued, there is an attached website <a href="http://robdunnlab.com/science-portfolio/bellybutton-portrait-series/?portfolioCats=38">Bellybutton Portrait Series </a>
<p><em>The Bellybutton Portrait Series is a set of photographs of microbial cultures of individuals that double as portraits of the subjectâ€™s microbial selves.</em></p>

However, if you thought this was about navel-gazing, you would only be partially correct.  This homework was a study of the library known as <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">Plotly ... for JavaScript</a>  It also has a Python variant which will be studied another day.  Plotly is built on top of <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stackgl">stack.gl</a>.  Plotly.js is a "high-level, declarative charting library and ships with over 40 chart types, including 3D charts, statistical graphs, and SVG maps."  Clearly, I have more work to do here.

### Instructions
Instructions are simple... follow this <a href="https://sharonpete.github.io/plotly-challenge/">link</a>

- Select a participant from the dropdown
- Note the top 10 Bacteria Cultures found
- Note the cool bubble chart with the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) for said person
- Note the gauge with the frequency of belly button washings for same
- Repeat with a different participant!
